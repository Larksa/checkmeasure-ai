## 🎯 Original Vision
AI-powered construction material calculation assistant that revolutionizes how Australian structural engineers process architectural drawings. The system should automatically extract measurements from PDFs, calculate material requirements according to AS1684 standards, and generate professional cutting lists that match existing client formats.

## 🔄 Current Understanding
- **[2025-07-27]**: Discovered that Claude Vision API requires proper authentication and the `anthropic` package
- **[2025-07-28]**: Realized the multi-agent system is more complex than initially thought - includes orchestration and event bus
- **[2025-07-28]**: Found that PDF analysis works through multiple fallback mechanisms (smart → advanced → basic)
- **[2025-07-28]**: Claude Vision successfully integrated and processing construction drawings
- **[2025-07-29]**: Pattern detection works but coordinate-based line drawing approach is flawed
- **[2025-07-29]**: Multi-agent area selection approach is superior - user control + AI analysis
- **[2025-07-29]**: Scale detection is critical and must precede any measurement extraction
- **[2025-07-29]**: Manual scale selection dropdown essential when auto-detection fails
- **[2025-07-29]**: Fixed critical errors: NoneType division, KeyError material_detected, UI stuck on analyzing
- **[2025-07-29]**: BREAKTHROUGH: Auto-calibration using standard components eliminates scale issues entirely!
- **[2025-07-30]**: MAJOR PIVOT: Replaced AI auto-calibration with mathematical scale calculation using PDF coordinates
- **[2025-07-30]**: 🎯 MILESTONE ACHIEVED: The most accurate dimension selection system we've built! Mathematical approach delivers 100% accuracy

## ❌ Failed Approaches

### Direct Package Import
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: Backend crashed due to missing `anthropic` package
- **Lesson Learned**: Always check requirements.txt for all imports
- **What to Try Instead**: Install missing packages before running

### FormData with Explicit Content-Type
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 1h
- **Why Failed**: Setting 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' manually doesn't include boundary parameter
- **Lesson Learned**: Let axios/fetch auto-set Content-Type for FormData
- **What to Try Instead**: Remove Content-Type header or set to undefined

### Ant Design File Upload originFileObj
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: Assumed file.originFileObj existed, but beforeUpload gives raw File object
- **Lesson Learned**: Check actual object structure with console.log before accessing properties
- **What to Try Instead**: Use the file object directly from beforeUpload

### Line Coordinate Drawing Approach
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 2h
- **Why Failed**: AI-provided pixel coordinates are imprecise, PDF orientation issues
- **Lesson Learned**: Don't rely on AI for exact positioning; use bounding boxes instead
- **What to Try Instead**: Area selection with visual confirmation

### Automatic Full-PDF Analysis
- **Date**: 2025-07-29  
- **Time Lost**: 1.5h
- **Why Failed**: Too ambitious - trying to detect all patterns at once
- **Lesson Learned**: User-guided selection is more accurate and gives control
- **What to Try Instead**: Let users select specific areas for analysis

### Sequential API Calls to Claude Vision
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h (ongoing issue)
- **Why Failed**: Pattern detection + measurement detection = 60s+ total time
- **Lesson Learned**: Long requests need proper timeout handling and user feedback
- **What to Try Instead**: Parallel API calls or progressive enhancement

### PDF Conversion Performance Issue
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 3h
- **Why Failed**: Converting entire PDF to images before cropping areas
- **Lesson Learned**: Only convert pages that are needed, process on demand
- **What to Try Instead**: Page-by-page conversion based on selected areas
- **Solution**: Grouped areas by page, convert only needed pages

### NoneType Division Errors
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 1h
- **Why Failed**: Not checking if values are None before division operations
- **Lesson Learned**: Always validate numeric values before arithmetic operations
- **What to Try Instead**: Use defensive coding: `value if value is not None else default`

### KeyError on Dictionary Access
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h  
- **Why Failed**: Trying to append to dictionary key that might not exist
- **Lesson Learned**: Check key existence or ensure creation path before appending
- **What to Try Instead**: Proper conditional logic for key creation

### UI Stuck on Analyzing State
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: No else clause when API returns empty detected_elements
- **Lesson Learned**: Handle all response scenarios, including empty results
- **What to Try Instead**: Always update UI state even for empty responses
