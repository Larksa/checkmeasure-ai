# CheckMeasureAI - Living Requirements

## üö¶ Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28 06:40 AM
**Phase**: Building / Testing
**Blocked By**: Nothing
**Next Action**: Test Claude Vision integration with real construction PDFs

## üìä Progress Overview
- Total Tasks: 15
- Completed: 12 (80%)
- In Progress: 2
- Discovered: 3 (tasks found during work)
- Failed Attempts: 1

## üéØ Original Vision
AI-powered construction material calculation assistant that revolutionizes how Australian structural engineers process architectural drawings. The system should automatically extract measurements from PDFs, calculate material requirements according to AS1684 standards, and generate professional cutting lists that match existing client formats.

## üîÑ Current Understanding
- **[2025-07-27]**: Discovered that Claude Vision API requires proper authentication and the `anthropic` package
- **[2025-07-28]**: Realized the multi-agent system is more complex than initially thought - includes orchestration and event bus
- **[2025-07-28]**: Found that PDF analysis works through multiple fallback mechanisms (smart ‚Üí advanced ‚Üí basic)
- **[2025-07-28]**: Claude Vision successfully integrated and processing construction drawings

## ‚ùå Failed Approaches

### Direct Package Import
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: Backend crashed due to missing `anthropic` package
- **Lesson Learned**: Always check requirements.txt for all imports
- **What to Try Instead**: Install missing packages before running
